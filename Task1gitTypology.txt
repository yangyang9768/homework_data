Complete definitions for key Git & GitHub terminology:


GIT WORKFLOW FUNDAMENTALS
·        Working Directory : The working directory is a single checkout of one version of the project. 
·        Staging Area:  Staging area is files that are going to be a part of the next commit, which lets git know what changes in the file are going to 		occur for the next commit.
·        Local Repo (head) The local repository is a Git repository that is stored on your computer
·        Remote repo (master): The remote repository is a Git repository that is stored on some remote computer.
 
WORKING DIRECTORY STATES:
·        Staged:  files that are ready to be committed to the repository you are working on.
·        Modified: The file in the repo as edited
·        Committed: keep track of our progress and changes as we work. all the work change of repo was saved.It is a point in the project you can go back to if you find a bug, or want to make a change.
 
GIT COMMANDS:
·        Git add : This command updates the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next 	commit. It typically adds the current content of existing paths as a whole, but with some options it can also be used to add content 	with only part of the changes made to the working tree files applied, or remove paths that do not exist in the working tree anymore.
·        Git commit: Create a new commit containing the current contents of the index and the given log message describing the changes. 
·        Git push: Updates remote refs using local refs, while sending objects necessary to complete the given refs.
·        Git fetch: Fetch branches and/or tags (collectively, "refs") from one or more other repositories, along with the objects necessary to 		complete their histories. 
·        Git merge: Incorporates changes from the named commits (since the time their histories diverged from the current branch) into the 		current branch. 
·        Git pull:git-pull - Fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch
